 QUESTION 3.
 
 Python Syntax and Semantics:
Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   - 
ANSWER

Simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:
      python

print("Hello, World!")

Explanation of Basic Syntax Elements.

1. print Function:
   
'print' is a built-in function in Python used to output text to the console. The function name is followed by parentheses () which contain the text or variables you want to print.

3. String:
   
'"Hello, World!"' is a string, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes ("). Strings can also be enclosed in single quotes (').

5. Parentheses:
   
'()' are used to enclose the argument(s) passed to the print function. In this case, the argument is the string "Hello, World!".

7. Quotation Marks:
   
'"' or ''' are used to define the start and end of a string.


QUESTION 4

Data Types and Variables:
List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

ANSWER

Basic Data Types in Python

1. Integer (int): Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals. Eg. 5, -3, 42.

2. Float (float): Numbers that have a decimal point. Eg. 3.14, -0.001, 2.0.

3. String (str): Sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Eg. "Hello", 'World'.

4. Boolean (bool): Represents one of two values: True or False. Eg. True, False.

5. List (list): An ordered collection of items, which can be of mixed data types, enclosed in square brackets. Eg. [1, 2, 3], ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].

6. Tuple (tuple): Similar to a list, but immutable (cannot be changed), enclosed in parentheses. |Eg. (1, 2, 3), ("apple", "banana", "cherry").

7. Dictionary (dict): An unordered collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces. Eg. {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}, {"apple": 3, "banana": 5}.

8. Set (set): An unordered collection of unique items, enclosed in curly braces.
Eg. {1, 2, 3}, {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}.

Script Demonstrating Basic Data Types

python

    #Integer

    age = 25

    print("Age:", age)

    print("Type of age:", type(age))
  

     #Float

       height = 5.9

         print("Height:", height)

         print("Type of height:", type(height))


         #String

          name = "Alice"

            print("Name:", name)

            print("Type of name:", type(name))


            #Boolean

         is_student = True

          print("Is student:", is_student)

         print("Type of is_student:", type(is_student))


            #List

            fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

            print("Fruits:", fruits)

            print("Type of fruits:", type(fruits))


            #Tuple

            coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

             print("Coordinates:", coordinates)

            print("Type of coordinates:", type(coordinates))


            #Dictionary

            person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

             print("Person:", person)

             print("Type of person:", type(person))


            #Set

            unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1}

             print("Unique numbers:", unique_numbers)

             print("Type of unique_numbers:", type(unique_numbers))

QUESTION 5

Control Structures:
Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

ANSWER

Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. The primary conditional statement in Python is the 'if' statement, which can be extended with 'elif' and 'else'.

'if-else' Statement

The 'if-else' statement evaluates a condition and executes code based on whether the condition is True or False.
Example:

python

     temperature = 25

     if temperature > 30:

    print("It's hot outside.")
    
     elif temperature > 20:

    print("It's warm outside.")
    
    else:

    print("It's cold outside.")

Loops in Python

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python has two primary loop constructs: for loops and while loops.

'for' Loop

A 'for' loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

Example:

python

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

     for fruit in fruits:

      print(fruit)

QUESTION 6

Functions in Python:

What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

ANSWER

Functions in Python

Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to organize your code into modular, manageable, and reusable pieces. Functions can take inputs, called arguments, and can return outputs.

Benefits of Function

1. Write code once and use it multiple times.
2. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
3. Easier to update and manage code.
4. Improves the structure and clarity of the code.

Function Definition:

- 'def sum_two_numbers(a, b):' defines a function named 'sum_two_numbers' that takes two parameters, 'a' and 'b'.

- 'return a + b' returns the sum of a and b.

Function Call:

'result' = sum_two_numbers(3, 5) calls the 'sum_two_numbers' function with arguments '3' and '5', and stores the result in the variable result.
    
- 'print("The sum is:", result)' prints the result.

QUESTION 7

Lists and Dictionaries:

Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

ANSWER

Differences Between Lists and Dictionaries in Python.

Lists
1. Elements have a defined order.
2. Elements are accessed using their index.
3. Elements can be changed after creation.
4. Allow Duplicates of elements.
5. Defined using square brackets [].

Dictionaries

1. Elements do not have a defined order (before Python 3.7).
2. Elements are stored as key-value pairs.
3. Keys and values can be changed after creation.
4. Keys must be unique; values can be duplicated.
5. Defined using curly braces {}.

Examples:

Script

python

        #Creating a list of numbers

        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

        #Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs

        person = {
    
        "name": "Alice",
    
         "age": 25,
    
          "city": "New York"
      }

         #Basic operations on the list

         print("Original list:", numbers)

         #Accessing elements by index

         print("First element:", numbers[0])

         #Adding an element to the end of the list

         numbers.append(6)

         print("List after appending 6:", numbers)

         #Removing an element from the list

         numbers.remove(3)

         print("List after removing 3:", numbers)
   
         #Basic operations on the dictionary

         print("\nOriginal dictionary:", person)

         #Accessing value by key

         print("Name:", person["name"])

         #Adding a new key-value pair

         person["email"] = "alice@example.com"

         print("Dictionary after adding email:", person)

         #Updating the value of an existing key

         person["age"] = 26

         print("Dictionary after updating age:", person)

         #Removing a key-value pair

         del person["city"]

         print("Dictionary after removing city:", person)

QUESTION 8

Exception Handling:
What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

ANSWER

Exception Handling in Python

Exception handling in Python allows you to manage and respond to runtime errors in a controlled manner. By using try, except, and finally blocks, you can catch and handle exceptions, preventing your program from crashing unexpectedly.

Example: Using 'try', 'except', and 'finally'

Script

python

       def divide(a, b):

      try:
        result = a / b
        
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        
        result = None
        
    except TypeError as e:
    
        print("Error: Invalid input type. Please enter numbers.")
        
        result = None
        
    else:
    
        print("Division successful.")
        
    finally:
    
        print("Execution of the division function is complete.")
        
      return result

       #Testing the function with different inputs

       print("Result:", divide(10, 2))
 
      print("Result:", divide(10, 0))

      print("Result:", divide(10, "a"))

QUESTION 9

Modules and Packages:
Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

ANSWER

Modules
A module is a single file (or files) that are imported under one import and used. It is essentially a file containing Python definitions and statements. 
Modules help in organizing Python code into manageable sections and provide a way to reuse code. They also help in maintaining a clean namespace and avoid naming conflicts.

Packages
A package is a collection of modules in directories that give a package hierarchy. A package must contain a special '__init__.py' file, which can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.
Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace by using dotted module names. For example, a package named 'mypackage' might contain modules such as 'mypackage.module1', 'mypackage.module2', etc.

Importing and Using a Module

To use a module in your script, one need to import it using the 'import' statement. You can import an entire module or specific functions, classes, or variables from a module.

Example Using The  'math Module:

Importing the Entire math Module

python

             import math

             #Using functions and constants from the math module

             result = math.sqrt(16)

             print("Square root of 25 is:", result)

             pi_value = math.pi

             print("Value of pi is:", pi_value1)

             Importing Specific Functions from the math Module from math import                sqrt, pi

             # Using the imported functions and constants directly
             result2 = sqrt(36)
             print("Square root of 36 is:", result)
             
             pi_value2 = pi
             print("Value of pi is:", pi_value2)

QUESTION 10

File I/O:
How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

ANSWER

READING FROM A FILE IN PYTHON

Use the 'open' function with the mode set to 'r' (read). After reading the file, close the file using the 'close' method or use a 'with' statement to handle the file, which automatically closes it after the block of code is executed.

Script to Read the Content of a File and Print It to the Console:
python
        # Reading from a file
        def read_file(filename):
        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as file:
              content = file.read()
               print(content)
         except FileNotFoundError:
              print(f"The file {filename} does not exist.")

      # Example usage
      read_file('example.txt')

WRITING TO A FILE IN PYTHON

Use the 'open' function with the mode set to 'w' (write). If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it exists, its content will be truncated. You can also use 'a' mode to append to the file.

Script to Write a List of Strings to a File:

python

         # Writing to a file
         def write_to_file(filename, lines):
              with open(filename, 'w') as file:
                 for line in lines:
                   file.write(line + '\n')

         # Example usage
         lines_to_write = ["Hello, World!", "This is a test.", "Writing to a file          in Python."]
         write_to_file('output.txt', lines_to_write)
